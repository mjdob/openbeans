# Reporting Security Issues

The OpenBeans team and community take security issues in the OpenBeans framework seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [obsecurity@mjdonlineuk.com](mailto:obsecurity@mjdonlineuk.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We'll work as hard as possible to respond quickly, and will keep you updated throughout the process of fixing any potential security issues and loopholes.
